HOW TO DEPLOY A MULTICHAIN-NODE
**************************************

1. Create a blockchain (the chain name, This4ThatChain, can be changed)

multichain-util.exe create This4ThatChain -datadir=.\config-server

2. Launch the Blockchain node

multichaind.exe This4ThatChain -datadir=.\config-server

3. Fill configuration file to read the necessary multichain parameters

On config-server/chain_parameters.xml fill up the fields with the necessary information.
	- The rpcUser and password can be found in file /config-server/{ChainName}/multichain.conf
	- The port number and the chainName can be found in file /config-server/{ChainName}/params.dat
	NOTE: These parameters are only available after creating the blockchain.

4. Connect another node to the existent blockchain

multichaind.exe This4ThatChain@192.168.1.115:7741 -datadir=.\config-client
NOTE : -port={port1} -rpcport={port2} is needed if two clients are running in the same machine.

A address will be presented in the output, this address must be delivered to the multichain admin, in order to give access to this address.


NOTES:

To execute a client in the console (2 nodes, same machine):

Client 1:
	- multichaind.exe This4ThatChain -datadir=.\config-server
	- multichain-cli.exe This4ThatChain -datadir=.\config-server [comand]

Client 2 :
	- start multichaind.exe This4ThatChain@[machine]:[port] -datadir=.\config-client -port=7742 -rpcport=7743
	- multichain-cli.exe This4ThatChain -datadir=.\config-client -rpcport=7743 [command]

When the client 2 connects to the multichain, it will download the multichain's configuration file which contains 
the definition of ports e.t.c. As we want to run two nodes on the same machine, the ports in the two nodes configuration will
be the same, so we have to change the ports of the second node by using in the multichaind.exe the parameters -port and -rpcport.
By doing that, the client 1 is connected to its node (Node1) and the client 2 is connected to its node, as well.
